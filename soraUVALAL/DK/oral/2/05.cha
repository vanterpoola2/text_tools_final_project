*CHI:	she was dead so she was following the girl to their house so she was killing everybody in that house . 
*CHI:	so every time you go into a place than she can go there too .
*CHI:	because she can follow her (.) and the son too . 
*CHI:	the son is like screaming and then he is going to kill you . 
*CHI:	so that's (.) ja@s:dan . 
*SON:	okay [/] okay . 
*CHI:	that was the scariest movie I think I saw . 
*SON:	oh@i I'm gonna see that one to see how it goes . 
*CHI:	but really it's a good movie and there is three of them so .
